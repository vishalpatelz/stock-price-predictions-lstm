Vishal Patel & Jeet Pandya (McMaster University)

The file structure as below,

#1. LSTMStockipynb.ipynb
#2. LSTM_Test.ipynb
#3. LSTM_Best_Model_1.keras

Run main file #1 which will test 3 different models using LSTM. It uses the yfinance library and downloads data of "AAPL"
The best-performing model will be saved for traying on #2.
Now run #2 file, which will use #3 as pre-trained model #3. It will try to predict the prices of "GOOGL" & "META"
